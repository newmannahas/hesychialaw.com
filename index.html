                <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
                <p><strong>Hesychia</strong>—from the Greek for stillness, quiet, and peace—is more than a name; it is my entire approach to the practice of law. I believe the most powerful advocacy arises not from noise and conflict, but from the clarity that can only be found in quiet contemplation. While others escalate, I resolve.</p>
                <p>My persuasion is built on the classical foundations: <code>logos</code> (logic), <code>ethos</code> (credibility), and <code>pathos</code> (values). But for me, <strong><code>logos</code>—unshakable soundness of reasoning—is the bedrock.</strong> When your case stands on solid ground, you are immune to procedural gamesmanship and litigation theater. You gain the peace of mind that comes from knowing your position can withstand any assault.</p>
                <blockquote>Too many lawyers ask, “How do I get an outcome?” I ask, <strong>“How do we <em>earn</em> it?”</strong> This is the essence of soundness. It means my appeals to ethos are rooted in genuine integrity, and my appeals to pathos serve to illuminate the human stakes, not to mask a weak argument. The result is advocacy that persuades because it is fundamentally true.</blockquote>

                        <h3>A Vested Partner, Not Just a Hired Lawyer</h3>
                        <p>I accept only cases that I find intellectually compelling and where I can make a decisive difference. This ensures your cause is championed by an advocate whose passion is aligned with your own. You deserve a lawyer who views your case as a mission, not just a file.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Aligned Incentives. Predictable Costs.</h3>
                        <p><strong>I have eliminated the billable hour entirely.</strong> This model is broken. It incentivizes inefficiency and creates a fundamental conflict between your interests and your lawyer's. Instead, I work on fixed-fee, contingency, and success-based structures. My success is intrinsically tied to yours. When you win, I win. It’s that simple.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Soundness Over Spectacle</h3>
                        <p>While some rely on courtroom theater, I build leverage through rigorous analysis, intellectual honesty, and clear thinking. My strategy is grounded in the merits of the case, creating a position of quiet strength that opponents respect and judges appreciate.</p>

                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>From Zero-Sum Fights to Value-Creating Solutions</h3>
                        <p>The best legal solutions often transcend the narrow confines of the dispute. By focusing on underlying interests rather than stated positions, I architect outcomes that create new value. An adversary can become a partner. I see these opportunities where others see only a fight to be won.</p>

                    <h3>A First-of-its-Kind Model for Appeals</h3>
                    <p>I handle high-stakes appeals on a contingency basis, believing you should pay for results, not effort. This model, rare in appellate practice, requires supreme confidence in the ability to identify legal error and craft winning arguments. You invest nothing unless I succeed in reversing an adverse decision or securing a favorable outcome.</p>

                <div class="service-item">
                    <h3>Building an Appeal-Proof Case from Day One</h3>
                    <p>The strongest appeals are built long before a notice of appeal is filed. I embed with trial teams to ensure every argument is preserved, every objection is perfected, and the entire record is constructed with the appellate court in mind. This strategic foresight is often the difference between a temporary setback and an irreversible loss.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-item">
                    <h3>Success-Based Motions to End Litigation</h3>
                    <p>I draft and argue case-ending dispositive motions—motions to dismiss and for summary judgment—on a success-fee basis. My compensation is contingent on achieving the goal: ending the litigation decisively and efficiently, saving you the cost and uncertainty of trial.</p>
                </div>
                 <div class="service-item">
                    <h3>Strategic Litigation & Pro Bono Advocacy</h3>
                    <p>I provide clear-eyed analysis of legal positions to help clients navigate complex disputes with confidence. A substantial portion of my practice is also dedicated to pro bono work, because I believe access to thoughtful, committed legal representation shouldn’t depend on the ability to pay.</p>
